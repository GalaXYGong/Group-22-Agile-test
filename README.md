Time to update the Readme

#1 Hey, we will fix the test directory issue later. For the time being. Throw tests into tests.py

#2 We gotta merge our other branches and then organize our Github. It's pretty important

#3 Things to clean out.
-1- the HTMLs
The following are confirmed Important: DON"T TOUCH THESE:
home.html, login.html, question.html, ranking.html, register.html, scores.html, test_db_data.html, profile.html, test_get_dict.html.

For the others, I am not sure. Someone check them out and confirm.

-2- Fonts.

Some fonts aren't in the fonts folder. Move them and make sure they work now.

-3- JS.

Some JS files are unnessary now. Like myscripts.js. We don't need fetch anymore. Delete it.
